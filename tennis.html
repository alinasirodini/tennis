                Roger Federer (/ˈfɛdərər/ FED-ər-ər; Swiss Standard German: [ˈrɔdʒər ˈfeːdərər]; born 8 August 1981) is
                a
                Swiss former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men's singles by the
                Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 310 weeks (second-most of all time), including a record
                237
                consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. Federer won 103 singles titles on the
                ATP
                Tour, the second most since the start of the Open Era in 1968, including 20 major men's singles titles
                (among which a record eight men's singles Wimbledon titles, and an Open Era joint-record five men's
                singles
                US Open titles) and six year-end championships.
                For nearly two decades, Federer was a leading figure in men's tennis alongside Rafael Nadal and Novak
                Djokovic, collectively known as the Big Three. A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998 and former ball boy,
                Federer won his first major singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at age 21.[3] For the next several years
                Federer was the dominant player in men's tennis, playing in 20 out of 24 major singles finals between
                2004
                and 2009. He won three of the four majors and the Tour Finals in 2004, 2006, and 2007, as well as five
                consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. Federer completed the career Grand Slam at the
                2009
                French Open after three consecutive runner-up finishes to Nadal, his main rival until 2010. At age 27,
                he
                surpassed Pete Sampras's record of 14 major men's singles titles at Wimbledon in 2009.

                Main article: Roger Federer's early career
                Federer in 1998, the first year he joined the ATP Tour
                In July 1998, an almost 17-year-old Federer made his ATP debut at the Swiss Open Gstaad, in his home
                country
                of Switzerland, losing to No. 88 Lucas Arnold Ker in the first round.[35][36] Later that year, he won
                his
                first ATP match against Guillaume Raoux in Toulouse.[37] He then received a wildcard to the 1998 Swiss
                Indoors in his hometown in Basel, where he lost in the first round to former world No. 1 Andre
                Agassi.[38]
                He finished 1998 ranked 301st in the world.[33]
                In April 1999, Federer made his Davis Cup debut in a World Group first round against Italy, defeating
                Davide
                Sanguinetti.[39] In August, Federer won his first-ever professional title on the Challenger tour in
                Segovia,
                pairing with Sander Groen to beat Ota Fukárek and Alejandro Hernández in the final, which was played on
                Federer's 18th birthday.[40] Despite losing in the first rounds of both the French Open and Wimbledon
                and
                having just turned 18, he entered the world’s Top 100 for the first time on 20 September 1999.[33] Later
                that month, Federer won his first and only singles ATP Challenger title in Brest, defeating Max Mirnyi
                in
                the final.[41] In his first full year as a professional, Federer jumped up to world No. 64,[24] and in
                doing
                so at 18 years and four months of age, he became the youngest player in the year-ending world top 100
