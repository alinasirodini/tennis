            Roger Federer (/ˈfɛdərər/ FED-ər-ər; Swiss Standard German: [ˈrɔdʒər ˈfeːdərər]; born 8 August 1981) is a
            Swiss former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men's singles by the
            Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 310 weeks (second-most of all time), including a record 237
            consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. Federer won 103 singles titles on the ATP
            Tour, the second most since the start of the Open Era in 1968, including 20 major men's singles titles
            (among which a record eight men's singles Wimbledon titles, and an Open Era joint-record five men's singles
            US Open titles) and six year-end championships.

            For nearly two decades, Federer was a leading figure in men's tennis alongside Rafael Nadal and Novak
            Djokovic, collectively known as the Big Three. A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998 and former ball boy,
            Federer won his first major singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at age 21.[3] For the next several years
            Federer was the dominant player in men's tennis, playing in 20 out of 24 major singles finals between 2004
            and 2009. He won three of the four majors and the Tour Finals in 2004, 2006, and 2007, as well as five
            consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. Federer completed the career Grand Slam at the 2009
            French Open after three consecutive runner-up finishes to Nadal, his main rival until 2010. At age 27, he
            surpassed Pete Sampras's record of 14 major men's singles titles at Wimbledon in 2009.

            Main article: Roger Federer's early career

            Federer in 1998, the first year he joined the ATP Tour
            In July 1998, an almost 17-year-old Federer made his ATP debut at the Swiss Open Gstaad, in his home country
            of Switzerland, losing to No. 88 Lucas Arnold Ker in the first round.[35][36] Later that year, he won his
            first ATP match against Guillaume Raoux in Toulouse.[37] He then received a wildcard to the 1998 Swiss
            Indoors in his hometown in Basel, where he lost in the first round to former world No. 1 Andre Agassi.[38]
            He finished 1998 ranked 301st in the world.[33]

            In April 1999, Federer made his Davis Cup debut in a World Group first round against Italy, defeating Davide
            Sanguinetti.[39] In August, Federer won his first-ever professional title on the Challenger tour in Segovia,
            pairing with Sander Groen to beat Ota Fukárek and Alejandro Hernández in the final, which was played on
            Federer's 18th birthday.[40] Despite losing in the first rounds of both the French Open and Wimbledon and
            having just turned 18, he entered the world’s Top 100 for the first time on 20 September 1999.[33] Later
            that month, Federer won his first and only singles ATP Challenger title in Brest, defeating Max Mirnyi in
            the final.[41] In his first full year as a professional, Federer jumped up to world No. 64,[24] and in doing
            so at 18 years and four months of age, he became the youngest player in the year-ending world top 100</p>
